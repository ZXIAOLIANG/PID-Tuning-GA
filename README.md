# Genetic Algorithm for PID tuning
Genetic Algorithm is implemented for PID tuning in ECE457A class 

The control module is defined in `perffcn.py`.

Generic Algorithm is defined in `GA` class, `GA_main.py` is going to generate plots for the fitness value in each generation vs. generation number. Please uncomment different code blocks to see how different configuration of GA affects the result.
